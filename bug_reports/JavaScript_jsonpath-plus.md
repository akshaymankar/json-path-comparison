Results do not match other implementations

The following queries provide results that do not match those of other implementations of JSONPath
(compare https://cburgmer.github.io/json-path-comparison/):

- [ ] `$[-1]`
  Input:
  ```
  ["first", "second", "third"]
  ```
  Expected output:
  ```
  ["third"]
  ```
  Actual output:
  ```
  []
  ```

- [ ] `$['key','another']`
  Input:
  ```
  {"key": "value", "another": "entry"}
  ```
  Expected output:
  ```
  ["value", "entry"]
  ```
  Actual output:
  ```
  []
  ```


For reference, the output was generated by the program in https://github.com/cburgmer/json-path-comparison/tree/master/implementations/JavaScript_jsonpath-plus.
