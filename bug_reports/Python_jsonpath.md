Results do not match other implementations

The following queries provide results that do not match those of other implementations of JSONPath
(compare https://cburgmer.github.io/json-path-comparison/):

- [ ] `$[-1]`
  Input:
  ```
  ["first", "second", "third"]
  ```
  Expected output:
  ```
  ["third"]
  ```
  Error:
  ```
  jsonpath returned false, this might indicate an error
  ```

- [ ] `$['*']`
  Input:
  ```
  {"*": "value"}
  ```
  Expected output:
  ```
  ["value"]
  ```
  Error:
  ```
  RecursionError('maximum recursion depth exceeded while calling a Python object')
  ```

- [ ] `$`
  Input:
  ```
  {"key": "value", "another key": {"complex": ["a", 1]}}
  ```
  Expected output:
  ```
  [{"another key": {"complex": ["a", 1]}, "key": "value"}]
  ```
  Error:
  ```
  jsonpath returned false, this might indicate an error
  ```


For reference, the output was generated by the program in https://github.com/cburgmer/json-path-comparison/tree/master/implementations/Python_jsonpath.
