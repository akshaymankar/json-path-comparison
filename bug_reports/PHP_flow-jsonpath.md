Results do not match other implementations

The following queries provide results that do not match those of other implementations of JSONPath
(compare https://cburgmer.github.io/json-path-comparison/):

- [ ] `$[:2]`
  Input:
  ```
  ["first", "second", "third", "forth", "fifth"]
  ```
  Expected output:
  ```
  ["first", "second"]
  ```
  Actual output:
  ```
  ["first", "second", "third"]
  ```

- [ ] `$[1:3]`
  Input:
  ```
  ["first", "second", "third", "forth", "fifth"]
  ```
  Expected output:
  ```
  ["second", "third"]
  ```
  Actual output:
  ```
  ["second", "third", "forth"]
  ```

- [ ] `$[0:3:1]`
  Input:
  ```
  ["first", "second", "third", "forth", "fifth"]
  ```
  Expected output:
  ```
  ["first", "second", "third"]
  ```
  Actual output:
  ```
  ["first", "second", "third", "forth"]
  ```

- [ ] `$[0:1]`
  Input:
  ```
  ["first", "second"]
  ```

  ```
  ["first"]
  ```
  Actual output:
  ```
  ["first", "second"]

For reference, the output was generated by the program in https://github.com/cburgmer/json-path-comparison/tree/master/implementations/PHP_flow-jsonpath.
